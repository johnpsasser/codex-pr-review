# chunk-diff.awk — Split a unified diff into ~chunk_size-line chunks
# along file and hunk boundaries. Splits mid-hunk when a hunk exceeds chunk_size.
#
# Usage:
#   awk -v chunk_size=10000 -v output_dir=/tmp/chunks -f chunk-diff.awk < diff.txt
#
# Output:
#   output_dir/chunk_001.diff, chunk_002.diff, ...
#   output_dir/chunk_count.txt  (contains the number of chunks)
